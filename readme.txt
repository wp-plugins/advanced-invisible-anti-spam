Block bots without making your users fill out captchas. Cache Friendly solution with rotating key! Activate and done!

== Description ==

Anti-Spam solutions that require your users to fill out captcha's are frustrating for actual humans, and not that great at stopping bots.

This solution works automatically without any user configuration, and puts no additional burden on your users to submit comments.

Key features:

*	Fully compatible with wordpress caching plugins or even more advanced server level caching solutions.
*	Utilizes a rotating token which changes every 24 hours, which stops more clever bots that might try caching the token.
*	Unique/Random field name which makes it difficult for spammers to script their bots to target this antispam solution.
*	Developer friendly with filters and actions
*	Uses native JavaScript to avoid jQuery dependancies

Requires JavaScript be enabled in client browser (Users will see a warning if JavaScript is disabled)
